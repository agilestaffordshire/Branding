Agile Staffordshire Branding Repository
=======================================

A place for logos, images and general branding artefacts to live.
Note that the brandings were created as svg vectors so that they can be scaled to any size, avoiding raster image scaling artefacts.
There are a number of pre-made png files that you can take and use.

* The svg files were created with [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/)

Working With Files
------------------
* Ensure you install the font from the provided zipfile.
* Download [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/). I used the [portable version](http://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/inkscape_portable) on Windows.
* Open agile\_staffs_brandings.svg
* Export to the size you require.


Please avoid changing the proportions of any object. Scaling is fine as long as you lock the ratio.

Feedback and contributions welcome.
